If you think you have been watching the fake news on [The Daily Show](http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/index.jhtml), read this report: [Fake TV News: Widespread and Undisclosed](http://www.freepress.net/docs/fake_tv_news_--__widespread_and_undisclosed.pdf) by Diane Farsetta and Daniel Price, [Center for Media and Democracy](http://www.prwatch.org/). In this report they offer videos of 36 "video news releases," the term for advertising that is conveyed to the consumer as "news." There is also a map showing where the 77 TV stations that aired the fake news are located. Brief of the report:

> Over a ten-month period, the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) documented television newsrooms' use of 36 video news releases ... (VNRs) ?a small sample of the thousands produced each year. CMD identified 77 television stations, from those in the largest to the smallest markets, that aired these VNRs or related satellite media tours ... (SMTs) in 98 separate instances, without disclosure to viewers. Collectively, these 77 stations reach more than half of the U.S. population. The VNRs and SMTs whose broadcast CMD documented were produced by three broadcast PR firms for 49 different clients, including General Motors, Intel, Pfizer and Capital One. In each case, these 77 television stations actively disguised the sponsored content to make it appear to be their own reporting. In almost all cases, stations failed to balance the clients' messages with independently-gathered footage or basic journalistic research. More than one-third of the time, stations aired the pre-packaged VNR in its entirety.
