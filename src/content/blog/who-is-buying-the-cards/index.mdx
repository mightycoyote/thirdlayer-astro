title: "Who is buying the cards?"

I have been working on my e-mail, trying to get a reasonable spam filter working, and I think I have it now. The only one that got through today was one offer for the Hillary deck. To be fair, three offers for the Hillary deck were caught in the filter. So, with my spam filter working, I have time to turn to more important questions and the first thing I want to know is just who is buying all of those decks of cards. Democrats and free-speech tolerant liberal humanist types wouldn?t want them. Republicans are all Christians, and Christians don?t play cards. So who is buying all of the cards?
