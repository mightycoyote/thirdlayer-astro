Our next Democratic Committee breakfast will be Saturday, November 20, at Golden Corral at Exit 7 at 9:00 a.m. Mark your calendars and invite a guest or two. Remember to tell the cashier that you are with the Democrats to get the group discount! We hope that more Democrats in the area will come out and get involved in activities, and we were encouraged by the number of folks we had at the regular meeting yesterday, in spite of the fact that several members had other obligations.

If you would like to be involved or just get to know other Democrats, come and share breakfast with us on the 20th of November and introduce yourself!
