For a couple of months now. or maybe more accurately a couple of months ago, because I didn't try a lot recently, I could edit and save entries, but the system kicked me back to the log-in when I tried to publish them. I figured that today I had time to get it figured out, so I made a new entry and it posted the first time. That is confusing.
