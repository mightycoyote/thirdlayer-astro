Always pay attention to the news on Friday. That is when they say anything that they don't really want you to hear. The [Friday story last week](http://money.cnn.com/2004/08/13/news/economy/election_taxes.reut/index.htm) was that the **TAX CUT** for people in the top 1 percent is roughly equal to 1.5 times the **total income** of people in the middle 20 percent and almost 5 times the **total income** of people in the bottom 20 percent.
