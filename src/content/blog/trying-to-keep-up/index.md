I have returned to work after June and July off, and I am discovering that work really takes up your day. I have some new pictures of the golden garden spider that has taken up residence in the shrubs in my front yard, and I will post a couple of good ones in the next day or so, I hope. Also, I am trying to keep up my "Reason of the Day" for voting for John Kerry (link on this page). I have been searching for a graphic to lend some design to my blog, and I believe that I now have one that will work, so I will be losing a couple of hours sleep working on that this weekend. So much to blog, so little time.
