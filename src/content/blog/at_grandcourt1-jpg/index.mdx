Our committee received an invitation from Grand Court to speak about our candidate for Congress! Catherine and I enjoyed spending time with the folks there today. We understand that other candidates were also invited, but we had the floor all to ourselves to talk about Rick and what he has done for our region. Thanks to Grand Court for the invitation, and to the residents who attended!
