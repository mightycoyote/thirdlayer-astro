If your desk at work is as busy as mine, you need a field trip, but this one is not safe for work. So when you have a minute that is your own, take a clicky-mouse hike over to [MediaChannel Dot Org](http://www.mediachannel.org/wordpress/2007/11/09/video-fox-attacks-decency-with-bill-oreilly-leading-the-way/) and look at some of the video from the folks who watch FOX so you don't have to! What can you say? Read the whole story and follow some of the links for interesting contrasts, like [the interview with James Dobson.](http://www.newshounds.us/2005/02/04/james_dobson_big_boobs_the_lingerie_bowl.php) Maybe that is what they mean by "fair and balanced."
