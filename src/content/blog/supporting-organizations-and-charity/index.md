If you are following the developing story about the charitable vs. the tax advantage aims of Supporting Organizations, Philip Cubeta at [Gift Hub](http://www.gifthub.org/2005/03/possible_abuses.html) has a good anecdotal definition of the issue. The [government issue paper (.pdf untitled document)](http://www.cof.org/files/Documents/Government/2005%20Issue%20Papers/05_FOTH_Supporting_Org_-_FINAL.pdf) is at http://www.cof.org/files/Documents/ Government/ 2005%20Issue%20Papers/05\_FOTH\_ Supporting\_Org\_-\_ FINAL.pdf. (That's the kind of URL that makes you appreciate links.) And if you have 10 million dollars (minimum) you can find assistance in setting up an SO at [National Philanthropic Trust](http://www.nptrust.org/donors/supporting_organizations.asp).
