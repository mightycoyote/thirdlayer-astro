Whether you liked or did not like the Super Bowl halftime show, there is one good effect of it, at least for me. I have yet to meet a single person who believed for an instant that Janet Jackson?s break-away (rip away?) wardrobe was a bona fide accident. What this means to me that Americans are awake and able to see and understand what is before them. I have more faith now that we will not have to suffer another four years of George W. Bush.
