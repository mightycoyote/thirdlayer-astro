In the "another one bites the dust" category, we have[Ted Haggard](http://www.tedhaggard.com/), who rounded up the vote for the federal marriage amendment and helped elect George W. Bush on Christian family values. On the "protest too much" platform we still have lots of candidates for possible nexts. So if you are thinking of voting the one-man, one-woman ticket tomorrow, consider the sources of your inspiration. Also you might want to think about:

- [300,129,764 men, women, and children in the United States](http://www.census.gov/) no longer protected by the guarantee of [_Habeas Corpus_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus).
- [21,609,000 U.S. families with children under 18](http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/pov/new03_100_01.htm) who are living below the poverty level.
- [2,868 military dead and 20,687 military wounded](http://icasualties.org/oif/) in Iraq [including someone who lived near you.](http://icasualties.org/oif/US_CITY.aspx)
- [46.6 million people in the U.S. without health insurance coverage](http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/hlthin05/hlth05asc.html)

I am sure others can come up with some more significant numbers, now that we are reasonably sure that even the ultra-right isn't as one-to-one as we have been led to believe.
