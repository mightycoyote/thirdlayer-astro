In an MSNBC story titled ["Hand-picked crowds for Social Security show: Bush preaches to the converted while pitching his overhaul plan"](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7162162) George W. Bush vows to keep saying it until we believe it:

> ?There is difference of opinion, and I?ve got mine,? Bush said in Memphis, Tenn. ?I?m going to continue traveling our country until it becomes abundantly clear to the American people we have a problem.?

I think he is still talking about a problem with Social Security, but who knows?
