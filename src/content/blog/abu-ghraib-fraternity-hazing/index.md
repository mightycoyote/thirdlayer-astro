I will leave that comment by JustaDog on my July 25 post, since it is a real comment by a person who read my blog. What I can't get over is how many Christians I meet who are willing to justify _our_ illegal and inhuman treatment of prisoners by citing _their_ atrocities. Of course I care about "executions performed by terrorists." I care about the children who die in war, theirs and ours, and about the families torn apart, some of them forever. I do not believe insurgents are righteous or that any torture is acceptable. And I do not understand how when we torture prisoners it "resembles fraternity hazing." I will point out that when Sadam or insurgents commit atrocities they do not do so with my tax money while wearing the uniform and standing under the flag that I grew up saluting.
