When things don't go well for some time, it is apparently reasonable to suggest that we need to kick out the incumbents, and I think it might be time to kick out the incumbents in religion. Christianity has been around for a long time and controlled kings and empires, and "peace on earth good will to men" has not happened. [Christian Dominionists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominionism) keep war against unbelievers on the front burner. Islam is a few years younger than Christianity, and they have that whole [jihad terrorist fatwa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fatwas) thing going -- a state of affairs that is not evidence of progress in meeting expectations for the good life. Judaism is over three thousand years old, and their God promised a lot more than has been delivered. Peace is even farther away from realization because each group has its own [supremacists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacism), which means we are all condemned to war until the last sect standing.

I am not suggesting that we kick out the incumbent God. God is either there and impervious to kicking out, or not there to kick out in the first place. But we do not hear directly from God, we hear from God's managers, translators, handlers, and emissaries who tell us what God wants us to do. They have had thousands of years to get the message right, and somehow the whole group of prelates, bishops, imams, preachers, prophets, gurus, rabbis, evangelists, and even the Pope himself, have been ineffective. If we kicked them all out and replaced them with people who weren't so much into the ideology, or the organization, or the profitability model, or whatever it is that has them stuck, maybe we would get a better result.
