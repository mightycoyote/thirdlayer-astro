You can't miss that big red graphic that just popped up on your right! [The calling was easy and well-organized.](http://www.thirdlayer.org/archives/000221.html) And afterward we all felt like we had contributed something to the cause of retiring failed Republican leadership and putting a more responsible and responsive government in Washington. This is one election in which everyone needs to be involved. If you can give a few minutes, click on the Call for Change graphic and help out.
