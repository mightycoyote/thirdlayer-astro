In case anybody is amazed that we didn't get a good response to Katrina from the federal government, that the recovery money is going to the same large corporations that are absorbing the Iraq appropriations, and that Bush intends to suspend environmental regulations and exempt from inheritance taxes the estate of anyone who died in Katrina's path that was worth more than 1.5 million dollars (I'm waiting to see who that person was) ... In case more tax cuts in spite of record deficits seem to you to be a little inconsistent with reality ... Remember Bush ran on a platform that said private individuals could spend money better than the federal government. His process since his election has been to cut, downsize, outsource, and let the people who have money keep more of it. His slow response to Katrina will enrich the rich and return more of our tax money to the "private sector," defined as the pockets of his political base. Small properties of middle income and poor people in the flood area will become part of the holdings of large companies. It is a scheme in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and the middle goes away.
