I have the jade tree ready to bring in, the amaryllis is blooming, the crabapple tree is ready for Halloween, dandelions are blooming close to the ground, the dogwood leaves are turning, the fuchsia is still trying to bloom, the holly we cut back is leafing out, the hydrangea is getting fall color, I re-potted the ivy, the mint is blooming, the orange tree is in a new pot and ready to come inside, the peach tree still looks like summer, one or two petunias are still blooming, the garden spider's egg case is still in place, and there are one or two tomatoes still hanging around. ![](images/1002ade.jpg) ![](images/1002amar1.jpg) ![](images/1002amar2.jpg)
