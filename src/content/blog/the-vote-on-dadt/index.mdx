Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is the only Democrat who voted against repeal of "don't ask, don't tell" yesterday. The 57-40 vote had 39 Republicans and Joe Manchin against. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark. abstained. Susan Collins, R-Maine, was the only Republican who voted for repeal.

The repeal was part of the National Defense Authorization Act passed by the House of Representatives to provide funding for veterans, soldiers, and their families.

Now people can quit calling Democrats ineffective and focus on Manchin and Lincoln, and Susan Collins should get some thank-you cards.
