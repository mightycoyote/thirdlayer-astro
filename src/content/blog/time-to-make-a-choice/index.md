This past year has brought two useful suggestions for preventing the spread of colds. One suggestion is that when you sneeze, do not cover your sneeze with your hand. Rather, sneeze into your elbow. This will prevent your getting cold germs on your hands and transferring them to objects that other people handle, like papers, door knobs, handrails, etc. The other suggestion is that when you have a cold and you need to shake hands with someone, do as the ancient Romans did. Each person reached out his weapon hand and clasped just below the elbow of the other. The Roman arm clasp prevents germs on one person's hands from getting onto the other person's hands. [I don't think we are there yet.](http://www.megalink.net/~dale/macarena.html)
