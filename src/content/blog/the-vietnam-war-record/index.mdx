As I said before (8/24/04), first the bully hits you, then he yells so the teacher looks and you can't hit him back. The difference is that while you did nothing wrong, the bully deserves to be hit. You are in pain, and the bully can gloat because he both injured you **and** made you look like a troublemaker at no cost to his reputation. Kerry earned his purple hearts.
