I will tell you what is wrong with pornography on the Internet. I just had to spend an hour cleaning up comments posted on my blog like "I love your site!" and "Thanks for creating this wonderful site!" with links to tripple-x locations. Apparently the people putting pornography on the net are not nice people. Who would have thought. Anyway, I guess now that I have been spammed I am officially a bolgger.
