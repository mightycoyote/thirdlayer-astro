Technically, this is my last vacation day, and on Monday (after the weekend) I will be back at work. The holidays have been great, with family visiting and lots of cards from friends. I have a newer (faster) computer, and one thing I hope to do in the coming months is to begin to keep up this web log with some content and a little design work. That is not exactly a new years resolution, just an intention.
