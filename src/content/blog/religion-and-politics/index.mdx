Some people believe in Hell, and others do not. I believe that Hell is just wishful thinking. For instance, imagine that you are George W. Bush, and you wake up one morning and realize exactly what you have done in the world. The first five seconds of that realization would be an eternity in Hell. But, you say, he will never wake up to that. He should, and we would be better off if he did, but it is still just wishful thinking.
