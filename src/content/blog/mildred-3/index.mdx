Millie came to our house in July about 20 years ago, and she passed away today. She took any opportunity to get someone to swing her in a basket and always made sure the bathtub faucet was dripping. If it wasn't, we had to fix it. We will miss her a lot.  
  
There are a few photos on Flickr, and these Jigzone puzzles from ancient times:
