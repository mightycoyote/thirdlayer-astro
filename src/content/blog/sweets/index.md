As I have been in treatment for breast cancer, many people have sent me cards, letters, and gifts of flowers, books, candles, lotions, and candy -- all very appreciated. The several entries today are photographs of some of the flowers. This one came from the students in the department where I work. Needless to say, these sorts of flowers are sort-lived!
