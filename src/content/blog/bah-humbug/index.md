I was going to put something on my blog about Cheney being a real-life honest-to-Christmas Pete Scrooge, but first I did a Google search on "Cheney Scrooge" and I got this result:

> Results 1 - 10 of about 53,200 for Cheney Scrooge. (0.23 seconds)

So maybe it has already been said enough. If there is a person in the country with an income under $150,000 a year who would still vote for a Republican, [that person needs intervention](http://www.lcurve.org/). Maybe a 12-step program to develop common sense.
