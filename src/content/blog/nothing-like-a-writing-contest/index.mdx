It is a short story contest with prizes including publication in an anthology, a real one, not one of those that just inserts your poem on page 39 and sells you a copy for $89.99 plus shipping. And if you are one of the top 10 that make it into the anghology, you will even get a free copy of the book and a discount on up to 20 more copies for your friends and cousins. So turn off the war news, put away the Free Cell, and break out your metaphors and similes. You have to write your story of no more than 4,000 words about someone or something being exposed to the contents of those bins the airlines are having everyone dump their liquids and gels into. It is a little scary, if you remember why we are doing this in the first place. The alleged ? not charged -- terrorists presumably had some idea of the effect of what they were planning to mix. We don't think they planned it to be a good effect, but it was predictable. Who knows what will come out of the dump bin? The rules and submission link are at [http://www.ItComesFrom.blogspot.com,](http://www.ItComesFrom.blogspot.com) and the anthology name will be _It Came From Airport Security_.
