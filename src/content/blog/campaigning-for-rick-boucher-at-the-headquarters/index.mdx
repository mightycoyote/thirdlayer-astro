Gearing up to start calling voters at Congressman Boucher's campaign headquarters in Abingdon on Wednesday morning, encouraging all Democrats to be sure their vote is counted!

This is an important election, and we need to make sure that everyone gets to the polls. Check with your neighbors and help to get out the vote.
