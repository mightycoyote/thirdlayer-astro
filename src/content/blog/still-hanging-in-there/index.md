[Reason of the Day to Vote for John Kerry and John Edwards](http://www.thirdlayer.org/sw/vote/index.html) And the spider is still there. She has picked the perfect spot to build, in a corner that has plenty of light and air but never gets direct sun and is sheltered from prevaling winds. She eats crickets, which are in good supply. The web was damaged once by a rainstorm, but she built it back quickly at just a little different angle. Here she is, photographed today at about 5:30 p.m.: ![](images/webspider2.jpg)
