Once or twice a year someone sends me e-mail from one of my web pages, so I think people still manage to find them, even though they are pretty well hidden. The ones that I hear from most often are [One-Room and Small Schools web page](http://www.thirdlayer.org/sw/school/index.html) and the [Literature and Meaning](http://www.thirdlayer.org/sw/540/index.html) web page, where I have posted lesson plans for _Sarah, Plain and Tall_ and _Blue Heron_.

Today I moved [these pages](http://www.thirdlayer.org/sw/index.html) to a new server, and some of the links might not work. On this new server everything is case sensitive. That means if the link is to "xyz.jpg" and the file is named "xyz.JPG," you will see broken link and not be able to find the file. I am of course working slowly through the links to make the necessary changes.

If you are visiting the One-Room and Small Schools web page or the Literature and Meaning web page (lesson plans for _Sarah, Plain and Tall_ and _Blue Heron_), and you need a broken link to work, send me e-mail and I will fix the one you need right away.

This will all come together in a few days!
