I understand that if you campaign for President and do not win, you don't take on any responsibilities, so after his campaign Ralph Nader can go back to his regular routine of doing nothing. Meanwhile, he will make a few speeches (no monumental task) and tour around the country a little bit, maybe see the Grand Canyon. He will get money for this from the Republicans, who will give him plenty because they believe he will take votes from the Democrats. When the dust dies down, he will take the leftover money, which is likely to be significant, and go home. He has found a niche in which a person works only one season out of every four years. I think Ron Paul has picked up on that and is hoping the Democrats will kick in a few bucks toward his retirement.
