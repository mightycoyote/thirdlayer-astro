Watching 60 Minutes last night, I was again impressed by the grace with which evangelical Christians so frequently come down on the wrong side of the logic fence. How is it that they can ask us to believe that government (education, economy, environment, human rights, etc.) should be in the hands of people who believe that the Apocalypse is already written by God into "future history" and most of the world is going to Hell very soon anyway?
