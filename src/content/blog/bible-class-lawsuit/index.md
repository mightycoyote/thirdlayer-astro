In an article titled [Advocacy groups sue to halt Bible classes in Texas schools,](http://www.cnn.com/2007/EDUCATION/05/16/bible.classes.ap/index.html) posted May 16 2007 by Education, from Associated Press in Dallas tells about eight parents in west Texas who are suing a school district over a Bible course. They say it violates their religious liberty, and they have sued to have the class discontinued:

> The American Civil Liberties Union and People for the American Way Foundation sued the Ector County Independent School District, asking the Odessa school system to stop teaching the course.

The people objecting to the program say that the course ?contains errors, dubious research and blatantly favors a fundamentalist, Protestant view of the Bible.? You can?t teach ?about? the Bible as literature without offending fundamentalists, and you can?t teach the fundamentalist viewpoint without offending just about everyone else. This will be an interesting case, since the brief story reports that one of the plaintiffs is a Presbyterian deacon. The course materials come from [National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools](http://www.bibleinschools.net/sdm.asp) (NC) and ?backers of the National Council include David Barton, who operates a Web site that promotes helping local officials develop policies that reflect Biblical views and encourages Christian involvement in civic affairs.? [American Family Association](http://www.afa.net), [Eagle Forum](http://www.eagleforum.org/) and Plano-based [Liberty Legal Institute](http://www.libertylegal.org) are named as supporters of the program. PFAW [outlines the origins and associations of the National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools,](http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=1353) and says that:

> NCBCPS has boasted that anywhere from 45 to 300 school districts have adopted its curriculum, but no one really knows, and NCBCPS won't tell the public. NCBCPS has generally refused to make its curriculum available for evaluation by scholars and the media, selectively disclosing it only to friendly school board members and parents.
