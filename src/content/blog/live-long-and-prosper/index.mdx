While God, guns, coal, and fracking remain our salient political issues in the U.S. and we debate whether or not health care is a human right, I hope that young people are hearing about these new technologies and getting as excited about them as I am. I am revising my intent to not live much past 100, just so I can see a lot of this stuff happen:

- The [solar globe](http://www.designboom.com/technology/betaray-spherical-glass-solar-energy-generator-by-rawlemon-12-18-2013/)
- The [bladeless, maintenance free, no bird-kill, no whistling sound wind turbine](http://www.gizmag.com/ewicon-bladeless-wind-turbine/26907/)
- And I want to own [something made of graphene](http://phys.org/news/2013-10-graphene-potential-carbon-atom-thick-material.html), but it looks like I might have to purchase that from Europe....
