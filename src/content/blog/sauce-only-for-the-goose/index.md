Sam Youngman on ["The Hill"](http://thehill.com) in an article titled ["White House insists it wants bipartisan health bill"](http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/white-house-insists-it-wants-bipartisan-health-bill-2009-08-19.html) reported:

> Some Democrats want the administration to use special budget reconciliation rules that could allow a healthcare reform bill to move through the Senate with only 51 votes. That would negate the need for Republican support.

But of course the Republicans have a good reason to oppose that:

> Former President George W. Bush used reconciliation rules to move tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. Republicans have argued using the rules to reform healthcare would be different because of the scope of the legislation.

Do they mean it would affect more people, and some of them would not be millionaires?
