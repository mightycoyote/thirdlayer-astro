From the New York Times, [Republican Woes Lead to Feuding by Conservatives](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/20/us/politics/20conserve.html?th&emc=th) By David D. Kirkpatrick:

> WASHINGTON, Oct. 19 ? Tax-cutters are calling evangelicals bullies. Christian conservatives say Republicans in Congress have let them down. Hawks say President Bush is bungling the war in Iraq. And many conservatives blame Representative Mark Foley?s sexual messages to teenage pages.

I guess it is possible they could all be right, right?
