Okay, so I forgot to leave a "comments" option on my previous entry. I am still figuring it out here! Here is the [rest of the picture from yesterday](http://www.thirdlayer.org/sw/puzzles/m_orange2.html), scrunched up into a small file so it can become a Jigzone puzzle, of course. If you like the puzzles, [Jigzone](http://www.jigzone.com) lets you have an account and make them from your own pictures. There are a few [other puzzles](http://www.thirdlayer.org/sw/puzzles/index.html) on my web page. Now, that is entirely enough of that.
