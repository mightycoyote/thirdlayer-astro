In an entry titled ["Ponzi Democracy,"](http://www.roryoconnor.org/blog/2008/12/23/ponzi-democracy/) Rory O'Connor, writing on his blog _Media is a Plural_, gives a brief history of the original Ponzi Scheme and asks " Is it possible, I wonder, that there may be a connection between the deregulation of the media and the fact that the same media never warned us of the dangers of financial deregulation?" If you are paying attention to the financial crisis (and who isn't?) or to the Bernie Madoff story, this article is worth reading, as are the comments it is drawing.
