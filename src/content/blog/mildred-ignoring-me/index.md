This is a photo of Mildred ignoring me. She does not pay much attention to me unless she wants brushed, wants the water turned on in the bathtub, wants Arby's roast beef (her favorite food) or, of course,if I am sitting in her chair. If I am nearby and she thinks I might want the chair, she makes it a point not to notice me, even if I have the camera.
