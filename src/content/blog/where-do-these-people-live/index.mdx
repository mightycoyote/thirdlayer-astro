Okay, the Southern Baptists are shrinking away to nothing, their children leaving the church in droves, as liberal education leads them astray. No, wait. I heard they were growing by leaps and bounds, controlling more and more areas of business and politics -- even elected one of their own to the highest office in the country, where he has appointed other like-minded faithful to high offices. It occurs to me that there may be two realities, and I am caught in one of those Star Treck episodes with a parallel universe....

> A resolution urging Southern Baptists to remove their children from public schools has been proposed by an Alexandria man for the denomination's annual convention in Indianapolis next month. Thomas C. Pinckney, a retired Air Force brigadier general and former second vice president of the Southern Baptist Convention, and Bruce Shortt, a Houston lawyer, co-submitted the resolution on April 29. "It dawned on us that academics were going downhill," said Mr. Pinckney, who edits the monthly Baptist Banner newspaper, which he said has a circulation of 20,000. "That was the beginning of our awakening." The resolution urges Southern Baptists to "remove their children from all government schools and see to it they receive a thoroughly Christian education." It also instructs the denomination, which is the nation's largest non-Catholic sect at 16.2 million members, to "counsel parents regarding their obligation to provide their children with a Christian education." It notes that public school students receive "an anti-Christian education," that public schools teach the acceptance of homosexuality and that student-run clubs friendly to homosexuals are spreading in public schools. Quoting a biblical passage comparing children to "arrows in the hands of a warrior," the resolution notes: "Just as it would be foolish for the warrior to give his arrows to his enemies, it is foolish for Christians to give their children to be trained in schools run by the enemies of God."

If SBC's Resolutions Committee decides to present the resolution to the full convention (June 15-16), it will need a simple majority to pass. If the committee rejects it, Mr. Pinckney can still introduce it on the floor, but it would need a two-thirds majority vote to pass.

> He \[Mr. Pinckney\] said many Christian parents eventually will boycott public schools. "Some public schools are doing a good job, as are some teachers who are Christians," he said. "But they are in a system that is officially and legally godless."
