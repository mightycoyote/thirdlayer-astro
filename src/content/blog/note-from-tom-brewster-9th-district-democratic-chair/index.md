Tom Brewster, Ninth District Democratic Chair, sends this message to Democrats in the Ninth District:

_Wednesday, November 3, 2010, 12:05 PM_

> Dear 9th District Committee, Chairs, and Special Friends,
> 
> I know that each one of you share my sentiments of disappointment over last nightâ€™s election results. Personally, I would like to thank our Congressman for his hard work, dedication, and loyalty to our 9th District Committee, Democratic Party, and constituents of the 9th Congressional District. Words cannot express our appreciation for his outstanding service. I look forward to continuing to work with Congressman Boucher on new and exciting projects in the future. He is no doubt the best Congressman in the United States of America. Now comes the difficult part, regrouping. It is important that we continue to grow our party and strengthen our organization here in the 9th Congressional District. I would love feedback on what our priorities should be as we move forward. Our local democratic committees, candidates, and elected officials need us now more than ever.
> 
> On a positive note, congratulations to 9th District Committee member, Joseph Puckett, on his election to the Russell County Board of Supervisors!
> 
> Thank you for your work during this campaign. I look forward to seeing you soon. Tom
