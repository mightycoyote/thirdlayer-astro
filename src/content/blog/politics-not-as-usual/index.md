I am still not too happy about the local Republicans stealing my Kerry/Edwards yard sign. That is just not nice at all. That kind of sneaking-around-at-night taking-what-does-not-belong-to-you breeds terrorism. I am usually a peaceful person, but I was trying to figure out a way to connect the sign to the 220v circuit that runs my dryer. I am ready for a little more tolerance and a little less bullying.
