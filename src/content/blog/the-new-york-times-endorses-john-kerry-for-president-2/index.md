[_The New York Times_ endorses John Kerry for President](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/opinion/17sun1.html). It continues to amaze me that any single person anywhere in any state in the United States still supports George W. Bush. If John Kerry promised only to undo half of what Bush has done, that would be enough. Instead he offers hope on many fronts, strong and reasonable plans that relate to real problems, and a record of public service that demonstrates character and consistency. In addition, he has something we have not seen in Washington for a long time, the willingness and ability to actually **think**.
