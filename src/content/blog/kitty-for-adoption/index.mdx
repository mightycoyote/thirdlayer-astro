Those of you who know Dixie know that this is a special kitten! Dixie said that she purred even through the bath. She is black with big gold eyes and huge tufted ears. Click on the photo to see this photo larger and another photograph. Send me e-mail (Sarah at Thirdlayer.org) for contact information. Note 9-13 at 9:00 p.m.: This kitten has been adopted and is no longer available.
