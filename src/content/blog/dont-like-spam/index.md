I like my blog, and it is great when friends (even those who do not agree) post comments. However, advertising spam is a pain. You have to be a real pest to do this kind of vandalism. I am going to keep the only last two entries open to comments. If you want to comment on a previous entry, please use one of these two entries and let me know which of my posts you are commenting upon. Having fewer openings for spammers will reduce my time spent deleting.
