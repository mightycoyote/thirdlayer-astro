The House of Representatives upheld the Bush veto of the children's health care bill yesterday, so the bill is going back to the White House with a few changes next month. Who believes anyone is looking at the changes? We apparently have no courts and no legislature, just one decider, and we are all supposed to hold our breath until 2008. If you don't know how your congressman voted, [you can look up that name here](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/roll982.xml). In case you are anxious about the executive branch taking over government, don't look now but [the "executive branch" is also disabled](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/15/washington/15interim.html), with interim heads running a lot of agencies that are supposed to be headed by appointed leaders approved by Congress. Instead, our President appoints an interim leader. It is not the executive branch that has become strong, it is the executive alone.
