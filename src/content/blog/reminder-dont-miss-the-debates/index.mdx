[Congressman Rick Boucher's website has information on the debates!](http://www.boucherforcongress.com/newsView.asp?NewsID=70)

All three candidates for Congress in the Ninth District have been invited to participate in two debates. WDBJ TV in Roanoke will broadcast a debate on October 26 at 7:00 PM. That debate will be available on TV in the Tri-Cities television area either live or as a rebroadcast, so check your local schedule and/or the [Boucher for Congress website](http://www.boucherforcongress.com/newsView.asp?NewsID=70) for the date and time. Then, on October 29 at 7:00 PM, WVVA TV in Bluefield will host a second debate.

Mark your calendar and check the broadcast schedule near the time of the debate so that you do not miss seeing the candidates in this important event.
