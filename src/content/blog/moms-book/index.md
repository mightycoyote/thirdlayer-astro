Last summer my mother and I worked on a collection of her writings, which include short stories, song lyrics, poems, and inspirational Bible Study pieces. She has written these over many years, for her church activities and other purposes. The book also contains her sketches of us (her children) as young children and of herself and my father and other sketches and drawings she has preserved. On the cover and in the back pages are photographs of quilts made by my two grandmothers and my husband's grandmother. This is a neat book, and I have enjoyed working on it. The book is [_Bits and Pieces and More_](http://www.lulu.com/helengobble) by Helen Gobble.
