From Greg on the Virginia Democrats website:[](http://www.vademocrats.org/news/items/mcdonnell_breaks_promise_on_stimulus_funds/)

> [McDonnell had stated at least five times that he would not reject any stimulus money,](http://www.vademocrats.org/news/items/mcdonnell_breaks_promise_on_stimulus_funds/) including saying in February that "we ought to take it to the maximum degree as possible." \[Washington Post, 2/27/09\] On February 27, 55 local elected officials from across Virginia signed a letter to McDonnell asking him whether he would join Governors like Bobby Jindal and Sarah Palin in rejecting portions of federal stimulus funds. In a response letter on March 4, McDonnell responded emphatically that he would accept federal funds. "If I am Governor I am not going to deny the taxpayers of Virginia the federal funding that they and their children are paying for."

I guess that it is now apparent that McDonnell will keep faith with his party ideologues even if it means selling out the citizens of the Commonwealth.
