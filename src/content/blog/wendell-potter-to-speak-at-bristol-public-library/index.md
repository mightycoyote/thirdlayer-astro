Mark your calendars to attend a Health Care Forum featuring [Wendell Potter](http://wendellpotter.com/) on Saturday, October 16, from 1:00 - 4:30 p.m. at the [Bristol Public Library](http://www.bristol-library.org/). Wendell Potter grew up in Mountain City and Kingsport. In 2008, after almost 20 years in the health insurance industry, Wendall left his position as the head of public relations at CIGNA to speak out against what he had seen in the health insurance industry. This should be a very interesting and informative forum. One you don't want to miss!
